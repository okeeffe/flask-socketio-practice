# flask-socketio-practice

Messing around with Flask-SocketIO for some real-time goodness.

Inspired by [@miguelgrinberg](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg)'s [Flask-SocketIO-Chat](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-SocketIO-Chat) project (particularly in project format, which I think Miguel is ace at).

### Running it

1. `git clone` and `cd` in there
2. `virtualenv venv` to set up a virtualenv (`pip install virtualenv` if you don't already have it)
3. `. venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python run.py`
5. Head to [localhost:5000](localhost:5000) in your browser(s) of choice

Tested on Python 2.7.13, no reason why it wouldn't also work on other versions.
